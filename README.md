# Fake Data

This project aims to provide a generator that allows for the creation of fake
data that looks plausible enough to be used in demos and/or for testing. It
tries to provide a set of tools that lets users specify the shape,
seasonality, and frequency of data to be generated, while still abstracting
the actual generation away.
